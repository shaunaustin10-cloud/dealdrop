# Marketing Ad Scripts & Strategy: REI Deal Drop

**Strategy:** "Organic First."
Don't spend money immediately. Record these videos and post them as Reels/TikToks. If one gets over 1,000 views organically, *that* is the one you put ad money behind (Boost/Promote).

## Ad Concept 1: The "Lying Wholesaler" (Target: Investors)
**Hook:** Stop getting burned by bad data. The AI is the "lie detector."

| Time | Visual | Audio (Script) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00-0:03** | (Face to camera, looking skeptical) Holding a piece of paper (a "deal"). | "Stop trusting the wholesaler's ARV. They are lying to you." |
| **0:03-0:08** | Screen recording: Typing address into REI Deal Drop. | "I got this deal sent to me claiming $50k profit. Let's ask the AI." |
| **0:08-0:12** | Screen recording: The AI "Thinking" -> Result pops up: **"PASS"** (Red text). | "Boom. REI Deal Drop flags it. It found the comps were 6 months old and the rehab was underestimated." |
| **0:12-0:15** | Face to camera. | "Don't buy a headache. Verify the deal in 30 seconds." |
| **Call to Action** | Text on screen: "Link in Bio" | "Try it free at the link in my bio." |

## Ad Concept 2: The "Spreadsheet Killer" (Target: High Volume)
**Hook:** Speed. Visual comparison of "Old Way" vs. "New Way."

| Time | Visual | Audio (Script) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00-0:04** | Split screen. Top: Someone frantically typing in Excel. Bottom: Someone sipping coffee, relaxed. | "This used to take me 45 minutes per property." |
| **0:04-0:10** | Full screen recording of REI Deal Drop. Smooth animation of the map and score loading. | "Now, I just drop the address into REI Deal Drop. It pulls the comps, calculates the rehab, and runs the 70% rule." |
| **0:10-0:13** | Zoom in on the **"92/100 HOMERUN"** score. | "It even gives me a confidence score so I know if the data is solid." |
| **Call to Action** | Text on screen: "Start Free" | "Stop wasting time. Analyze your first 3 deals for free." |

## Ad Concept 3: The "Listing Win" (Target: Agents)
**Hook:** Authority and professionalism.

| Time | Visual | Audio (Script) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00-0:03** | POV shot: Throwing a beautiful printed PDF report onto a table. | "This is how you win the listing appointment." |
| **0:03-0:08** | Panning over the paper report showing charts, maps, and the "Conservative Valuation." | "While other agents bring a Zillow printout, you bring a full data-backed market analysis." |
| **0:08-0:12** | Screen recording: Clicking "Generate PDF" button -> PDF opens instantly. | "One click. Branded to you. Professional grade." |
| **Call to Action** | Text on screen: "For Agents & Investors" | "Level up your presentation. Get your account today." |
